## New format: AsciiDoc
AsciiDoc is one of the new formats that are now supported.

## New format: CSV
[CSV files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) are supported now (in sense of syntax highlighting and preview).

* Editor with SyntaxHighlighter
* Each csv column is shown in a different unique color to see which csv-data belongs to which colum/header
* Preview as html-Table with export as pdf
* A csv column may contain markdown (see column with picture in the screenshot)

![](doc/assets/csv/2023-06-25-csv-landscape.webp)

## New format: Org-Mode
The third and last new format newly added is Org-Mode. Note that currently only editor syntax highlighting and action buttons to make editing easier are available.
There is no dedicated view mode implemented.

# Markor v2.10 - Custom file templates, Share Into automatically remove URL tracking parameters
_16. July 2022_


## Share Into: Automatically remove tracking parameters
Did you know you can share content and URLs into Markor? One of the core features or Markor is **Share Into**, a window specifically for sharing stuff into Markor and quickly appending to existing files (like QuickNote & ToDo), recent opened files or to write into new created files - all from the same place.  

![Share Into](doc/assets/2022-07-16-share-into.webp)

* Beside QuickNote & ToDo you might recall another special file at Markor - LinkBox. One of the main features of Share Into is to share links (from i.e. your web browser) into Markor, to **create bookmarks & link lists**.  
* Text/Title of links and the URL are extracted and automatically formated in Markdown syntax, resulting in fancy clickable links when you view your Markdown documents later. Note that **you can share any text into Markor, it is not limited to links**.
* Often shared text is not the way you want it. You can **edit text prior appending it to your file**. As shown in the screenshot above there is a editor with syntax highlighting. So if you have to add a few words, rewrite & restructure some text prior pasting - go ahead, no problem.
* You can also re-share the text without adding it to any file (i.e. share into Markor, add a few words, share the final text to 5 messenger contacts)
* Sometimes apps only have the option to share a web-accessible link, but none to open it yourself in the browser. In case a URL is in the shared text, Markor also shows the option to open the link in a browser.

**New in Markor 2.10**

Automatically remove tracking & analytics parameters from URLs shared into Markor.  
Usually when you share URLs from articles you will notice that it is multiple lines long, by adding a lot of unwanted tracking & analytics parameters.  
Markor helps you here to clean the URLs prior displaying them - by removing parameters like utm_, ref, fbclid & more.

- [ShareInto: Filter few additional tracking parameters in shared URLs, by @gsantner](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/issues/1490)




## New file dialog: Custom file templates & snippets
(See also: [Markor 2.9 Snippets / custom templates](#snippets--custom-templates))

Create as many custom snippets / templates you like by placing textfiles in the subdirectory `.app/snippets` of your Markor notebook (start) directory.   
Open a document and place the cursor on whatever position you want to insert text.   
Then click the new snippets button on the bottom-bar (see screenshot) and select the desired snippet. 

<small>Note: The snippet directory is automatically created the first time you click the snippets button in the bottom-bar.</small>

![Snippets](doc/assets/2022-05-14-snippets.webp)


**NEW (Added in Markor 2.10)**

- [New file dialog: Custom file templates, using snippets folder (notebook/.app/snippets), by @gsantner, closes #676](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/issues/676)

Being able to make custom file templates and creating new files of it was a very frequent requested feature.  
Now with this Markor update this feature is available. Using the same system like snippets (as seen above) you can create files out of templates directly in the _new file_ dialog.  

With this improvement the system is even more flexible - based on the same templates you create once, you can 

* create & start editing a complete new file
* insert anywhere right at the cursor while editing a file

![Share Into](doc/assets/2022-07-16-newfile.webp)

# Markor v2.8 - Multi-selection for todo.txt dialogs
_29. July 2021_


## Multi-selection for todo.txt dialogs
Multi-selection was added to Markor's dialogs, particularly for the todo.txt format.

* You can now select multiple context & formats to search for, or to insert.

* The search button (top menu) will also show the multi-selection when you have a file in todo.txt format open.
If you select multiple todos and they are not one after the other, then those entries are reorder. 
Afterwards all selected entries will be highlighted in the editor, and you may apply actions on them. Like mark all of them as done or add one or more contexts.

# Markor v2.7 - Search in content, Backup & Restore settings
_26. June 2021_


## Search files by content
You can recursive search for files by their contents now. The search button remains at it's place at the file managers top menu.  
The popup dialog has new options to configure search in content or only by filename, case sensitivity and if the search in content should use the input as regex.

![files by content](doc/assets/2021-06-26-filebrowser-search-files-by-content.webp)


## Backup & Restore settings
You can backup & restore Markor's settings now, there is a new option in the settings for each.  
The backup is a json text file.

![backup](doc/assets/2021-06-26-settings-backup-restore.webp)


## Per-file settings: Font size
Per-file settings were introduced in the [Markor v2.5 update](#per-file-settings).

With this update, file size is now also controllable & saved per file via the editor's top menu.  
The standard/default configuration is still available in the global settings (used if you did not pick a custom font size for the current file).

## File Manager: Conflict handling for existing files
With this update, Markor will ask you what should be done when you are about to move/copy a file but a file of same name already exists.  
You can decide to skip (keep old target file) or overwrite with the new file, or keep both.

When you copy/move multiple files, you get the option to apply the decision (skip/overwrite/keep) to all files or only the file shown in dialog.

# Markor v2.6 - Zim Wiki, Newline = New Paragraph, Save Format
_28. February 2021_


## Zim Wiki improved
Zim Wiki was introduced in the [previous update Markor v2.5](#new-format-zim-wiki).  
This update includes many quality improvements and additions for Zim Wiki:

- Editor: Support Table of contents (top menu)
- Simplify Zim format detection
- Add more text actions (links, images, checkbox, ..)
- Support file generation on older Android versions

If you don't know how the Zim format & syntax works, Markor also includes a reference template  
that gives you an overview. It is available from the `+ (New file)` dialog in the app or from [GitHub](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/tree/master/samples).

![Zim](doc/assets/2020-12-20-zim-reference2.webp)

## Newline = new paragraph

By Markdown (more precise - CommonMark) specification, new lines only start a new paragraph when you end the line with two spaces  (in the View Mode & exports).
You might prefer to always start new lines. For this case there is a new settings option - with it enabled new lines also start a new paragraph.

You can enable this opt-in settings option in the Markdown section.

## Per-file settings: Remember selected Format
Per-file settings were introduced in the [previous update Markor v2.5](#per-file-settings).  

With this update, Format selection has been reworked. The selected Format is now remembered and restored for each file 
and was moved to the _File settings_ submenu at the top menu. The current selected Format is now highlighted.

## Search & Replace - Simple or Regex
Text replace functionality was added to Markor - for both simple and advanced use cases.  

* You can do **simple text replacement**s ( `text a` -> `text b` )
* You can do **Regex replacement**s ( `.*http.*` -> `Link removed`)
* You can do **Replace (1)** (next occurrence from current cursor position)
* You can **Replace all** (all occurrences in the current file)
* You can **view the amount of matches** - count specific words, characters & more (optionally with regex)

### How to replace?
1. Open a file & use the Search button in the toolbar (🔍) 
2. Open the Replace popup via _Search / Replace_
3. Enter search text & the replacement, check regex/multiline as needed
4. Use Replace (1) or all to execute the replacement

### How does it look like?

![search](doc/assets/2020-12-20-search-replace-simple-or-regex2.webp)


## Tooling changes

### Android SDK & supported devices
Markor is now built with Android SDK 29, minimum required by Google Play.  
Markors minimum supported Android version remains unchanged - „Android Jelly Bean 4.1 (API16)“.

### Continuous Integration & Delivery
The project switched to GitHub Actions for CI/CD as it integrates best with GitHub & there are no relevant restrictions for Open Source projects currently.  

#### Benefits for users
The switch not only comes with benefits for developers, but also users.  
Download & install development builds of Markor from the GitHub Actions artifacts now.  
You can install the test app (Marder) beside Markor.

This means you can see in-development features & try them before any update is released.  
Not only builds of merged changes are available for download, but also from upcoming changes of <i>not-yet-</i>merged pull requests.  
[Open a build to download apk, build & test logs, apk info & more.](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/actions).  

## Per file settings
Some file specific options were added to the editor toolbar menu.  
The global settings are still used as long you don't toggle/change any setting in a file.

You can find the File-Settings in the top toolbar, given you have a file open.  

It currently includes:

* File format (Plaintext / Key-Value / Markdown / todo.txt / Zim Wiki)
* Enable/Disable line wrapping
* Enable/Disable syntax highlighting

## New color schemes & templates
* Nord editor color scheme was added
* Zim Wiki related templates/samples were added
* Zettelkasten template/sample was added


## Project community
Markor gets a lot of new features, improvements and fixes with every update.  
Shout out to [Harshad Srinivasan](https://github.com/harshad1), [Frederic Jacob](https://github.com/fredericjacob), [Peter Schwede](https://github.com/pschwede), [Gregor Santner](https://github.com/gsantner). Thank you very much!

# Markor v2.3 - Table of Contents, Custom Action Order
_25. July 2020_


### Markdown: Table of Contents in Edit Mode
Table of contents were already supported at Markdown view mode since quite some time (optional setting).  
A similar functionality is now available for Markdown Edit Mode too.  
Tap the filename at the toolbar to open the Outline (see screenshot below).

## Create Presentations with Markor & Markdown

![presentation gif](doc/assets/2019-10-27-markor-presentation-v1.gif)

Markor makes creating presentation slides with plaintext faster & easier than ever.  
Presentations can be exported & shared as PDF & HTML.
This means you can create & prepare for presentations fast with Markor, open it on a PC or share it via E-Mail & WhatsApp.

The example presentation (as seen in the video) is bundled with Markor. 
Press the `+` button at the file browser to create a new file, select the `presentation-beamer.md` template and you get the whole _Abed Nadir_ presentation.  
It's the easiest way to start your presentation as most common slide styles are included. (Like custom slide background color & image, centered image, bullet points, title only slides, ..)

Excerpt of the presentation, includes information about the syntax:


```
---
class: beamer
---

-----------------
# Cool presentation

## Abed Nadir

{{ post.date_today }}

-----------------
## Slide title


1. All Markdown features of Markor are **supported** for Slides too
2. Start new slides with 3 more hyphens (---) separated by empty lines
3. End last slide with hyphens too
4. Slide backgrounds can be configured using CSS, for all and individual slides
5. Print / PDF export in landscape mode
6. Create title only slides (like first slide) by starting the slide (line after ---) with "# title"


-----------------
## Slide with centered image
* Images can be centered by adding 'imghcenter' in alt text & grown to page size with 'imgbig'
* Example: `![text imghcenter imgbig text](a.jpg)`

![imghcenter imgbig](file:///android_asset/img/flowerfield.jpg)

# Markor v2.0 - Search, dotFiles, PDF export
_03. July 2019_


## Recursive file search
File search has returned to Markor! Search is decoupled from file browser and supports recursive file search.  
In the editor there is also a new dedicated button in the menu toolbar for search.  
Now there is always a search button available in all type of pages, even better it's always at the same position.

![Showcase](doc/assets/2019-07-03-markor-v2-0-showcase-1.webp)  


### Improved image, PDF sharing and printing
The color scheme is now automatically switched to light with white background, when sharing or exporting a document as PDF or image.
As PDF export and printing uses the same Android feature, the improvement is also available for priting.

With this change, Markor will always automatically generate clean white documents for you (without theme specific background color), perfect for printing.


### Improved file handling
Markor will ask now if a file should be opened inside editor, if it's one of the extended list of expected file typs.
You will now get a dialog to choose between Markor or external app. This list of file types includes but is not limited
to data exchange (like csv, json, xml, yaml) anddevelopment (c++, java, python, ruby, golang, bash) files types.

There is also a new settings option in the general section, which allows to specify a comma seperated list of
file extensions that always should be opened with Markor.
If you want to open files with .mytype extension, as well files without extension: `None, .mytype`.

### More changes
- Always view files starting with "index."
- Setting to configure wrap mode (=line breaking)
- Menu option for reload file (editor/viewer)
- Menu option for hiding files & folders starting with a dot
- Setting to set tab width
- Improve back button when always start view mode is set
- Keep file browser sort order
- Improve inline code highlighting
- Add new line when archiving tasks

# Markor v1.8 - All new file browser, favourites and faster Markdown preview
_03. July 2019_

## All new file browser

![showcase](doc/assets/2019-05-06-markor-v1-8-showcase-1.webp)

* The old file browser was removed and replaced by a new compact solution. It is based on the file browser known from import dialog.
* The previous "Notebook" tab in the main screen is now called "Files". Notebook is now just your document "home" folder. 
* You can now freely navigate the filesystem and all files are shown (previously: only folders and text documents).


#### Favourites
* Add any file or folder to your favourites! Long press a file/folder and tap the star button to add to or remove from favourites.
* Favourite files are highlighted by Markor's red accent color.
* Use the new quick navigation menu option to quickly navigate to your favourites, recently viewed files and more.
* Favourites are listed as normal files/folders in the file browser. They appear virtual under the special folder `/storage/favourite-files`. When a folder gets selected, the file browser will navigate to the real folder. Files get opened.
* You can also set `Favourites` as default folder to load on app start. Check out the blog post section about settings!


## Improved SD Card support

![sdcard](doc/assets/2019-05-06-sdcard-mount.webp)

* Markor now uses the Android Storage Access Framework to access SD cards.
* To mount a SD card (so files can be edited by Markor), navigate to the SD card folder.
* (first screenshot) Press the `+` button and a descrptive dialog appears.
* (second screenshot) Follow the steps shown in the dialog to give Markor access to your SD card.
* (third screenshot) Files on the SD card are not striked out anymore, which means Markor has write access to the file/folder.

## New and updated Settings

![showcase](doc/assets/2019-05-06-markor-v1-8-showcase-3.webp)

#### App start folder
You can find this new option at `General -> App start folder`. It allows you to select the special folder to load when Markor starts. The default is Notebook.

# Markor v1.7 - Custom Fonts, LinkBox with Markdown
_11. March 2019_

![showcase](doc/assets/2019-03-11-markor-v1-7-showcase-3.webp)


#### App Shortcuts
(left screenshot) Use the new [App Shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts) feature to quickly open one of the special documents or a recent document.
Long press one of the options to add the shortcut directly to your launcher desktop!

**Did you know** that you can create a launcher desktop shortcut for any document?
Press the share button while a document is open and select the _Create shortcut_ option.

The feature requires at least Android Nougat (v7.1).
You can't use App Shortcuts on older Android versions.
The traditional launcher shortcut option works on any Android version!  

#### WikiLink syntax
(right screenshot) Refer to other documents using the WikiLink syntax (known from Wikipedia & Mediawiki).  
The screenshot shows some ways how you can refer to other documents and files, using Markdown and WikiLink syntax.

**Important**: Automatic file extension detection is only available for text documents (.md, .txt).
Add the extension (like .jpg/.pdf) for all other file types!  



## Improved LinkBox

**Share into: Link Markdown syntax**  
When sharing links from your browser to Markor, they are now automatically converted to Markdown syntax!
This feature requires that your (browser) app sets the link and text attribute separately (yes, it works with Firefox, Chrome).


**LinkBox changed to use Markdown format by default**  
On new installations, LinkBox is now a file in Markdown format named `LinkBox.md`.
This allows you to easily browse links with title only, without distracting http urls.
Just switch to the representation/preview mode!  
As shared links default to Markdown syntax, just share to LinkBox and browse distraction free without changing anything!

**LinkBox listed in main navigation**
Often request and now available: LinkBox is now listed in the main navigation too!


## Open links quick & fast
**Did you know** that you can press the _open in external app/browser_ button to open the link in a different app?  
Just touch (place the cursor) at or after the link you want to open.
The link before or at to the current cursor will be opened, you can but don't need to click directly at the link beginning or ending.

**This functionality is available for any document in any format.**  
It is also available at `Share Into`, so you can replace `Open Link With` / `open shared link` kind of apps with Markor.


## Use custom fonts
You can now add custom fonts to Markor!

Custom fonts do change the default text appearance in edit & representation mode.
They work just as normal fonts do, but you need to install for them to appear.

**Install font**: Copy font to one of these locations:

* (Markor Notebook)/.app/fonts/
* /storage/emulated/0/Fonts/
* /sdcard/Fonts/

**Select font**: Settings option at Editor -> Document Editor Font

* 1: System (default) fonts are always listed on top.
  * The default option is Roboto Regular (sans-serif-regular)
* 2/3: Custom fonts are listed below system fonts. The font name is taken from the filename. To identify the correct font the absolute path is shown as well. Custom fonts are ordered as listed in _Install font__
* 4: Bundled fonts


#### Bundled fonts
Markor comes now bundled with some additional common fonts (free & open license only):

<table>
<tr><th>Font</th><th>Alternative to</th><th>Known from</th></tr>
<tr><td>Liberation Mono</td><td>Courier New</td><td>Microsoft Wordpad</td></tr>
<tr><td>Liberation Sans</td><td>Arial</td><td>Google Docs</td></tr>
<tr><td>Liberation Serif</td><td>Times New Roman</td><td>Previous default Microsoft Word font</td></tr>
<tr><td>Open Sans</td><td>Calibri</td><td>Default Microsoft Word font</td></tr>
<tr><td>Roboto Slab</td><td></td><td>Google Keep</td></tr>

<tr><td>Source Sans Pro</td><td></td><td>Popular font for websites</td></tr>
<tr><td>Source Serif Pro</td><td></td><td>Popular font for websites</td></tr>
<tr><td>Source Code Pro</td><td></td><td>Popular font for editing code</td></tr>
</table>


## New settings options

![showcase](doc/assets/2019-03-11-markor-v1-7-showcase-4.webp)


<table style="table-layout: fixed;">
<tr><td>Document browser --> App start tab</td><td>Select which tab should be selected when starting Markor.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Editor -> Document Editor Font</td><td>Select which font should be used at edit/representation mode</td></tr>
