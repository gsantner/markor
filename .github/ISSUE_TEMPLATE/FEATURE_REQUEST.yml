        - label: Markor **is** up to date. See [Releases](https://github.com/gsantner/markor/tags) for the latest version. Updates are available from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.gsantner.markor/) and GitHub. 
          required: true
        - label: The wanted feature/enhancement is not present in the latest development version (git master). (Please [download](https://nightly.link/gsantner/markor/workflows/build-android-project/master) and try the test version of Markor, named **Mordor**. Don't worry; Markor and Mordor appear as completely separate applications. You can install both side-by-side, and Markor's settings are not touched. If your desired feature is present, you don't need to open this issue. The change will be part of the next Markor update.)
