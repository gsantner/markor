# FAQ

## File browser & file management

#### How do I save a file?
Markor automatically saves text when you leave Markor or close a file. Additionally there is save button in the top menu.

#### How do I save files to SD Cards?
Browse to the start folder of your SD Card and press the + button (using file browser or the menu option). Now press the plus button and follow the steps in the dialog. Afterwards Markor's file browser won't strike out filenames anymore and files are writable.

![sdcard-mount](doc/assets/2019-05-06-sdcard-mount.webp)

#### How to synchronize files?
Markor is and will stay an offline focused application. It works with sync synchronization apps, they have to do syncing respectively.
Sync clients known to work in combination include BitTorrent Sync, Dropbox, FolderSync, OwnCloud, NextCloud, Seafile, Syncthing, Syncopoli and others.  
The project recommendation is Syncthing. [-> Guide for Syncthing](doc/2020-04-04-syncthing-file-sync-setup-how-to-use-with-markor.md)

#### What is Notebook?
The root folder of your files! Markor starts with this folder at the main screen and allows you to browse files. You can work at any (accessible) file & location with Markor.

#### What is ToDo?
Your main to-do list file in todo.txt format. You can access it by swiping once at the main screen, by selecting todo.txt at Notebook, or by using the dedicated launcher. You can also open it from Notebook or other apps! You will also have the option to create a to-do task when sharing text into Markor when the text is just one line. The location of this file is freely choosable and independent from the Notebook directory.

#### What is QuickNote?
The fastest and easiest way to take notes! QuickNote is a file in Markdown format with a freely choosable file location. You can access it by swiping twice at the main screen, by selecting QuickNote at Notebook, or by using the dedicated launcher. The location of this file is freely choosable and independent from the Notebook directory.

#### Launchers
A launcher is a "start menu option" in your devices launcher (=appdrawer / start menu). When Markor is installed you have the start menu option for Markor. When the Markor settings option "Launcher (Special Documents)" is enabled, you get the additional start menu options for ToDo and QuickNote. Note that a device restart is required when you change this option.

## Format: Markdown
#### What is Markdown?
A general purpose markup format for documents of all kinds. As Markdown gets converted to HTML prior displaying a rendered view, you can also include HTML in the text, thus you can do everything web browsers can do.

CommonMark is the specification that the markdown parser used in Markor implements.

#### Links to files that contains spaces
Most Markdown applications use URL encoding for links, so does Markor. This means replace every space` ` with `%20`. This ensures that your Markdown content is compatible with most other Markdown applications.<br/><br/>

Markor has a dedicated button for adding links and file references, which automatically applies this appropiate format.  Take a look at this [video](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6735650/63089879-e6aa9400-bf48-11e9-87c1-78a1ba1c444f.gif) to find out where the file reference button is located and how to use it.<br/><br/>

Example: `[alt](my cool file.md)` ‚Æï `[alt](my%20cool%20file.md)`.

#### Can I use Markor in class to write down equations? (Math)
Yes, Markor has advanced functionalities for math! Enable the feature by checking Settings¬ªFormat¬ªMarkdown¬ªMath.<br/><br/>

Markor's [markdown-reference.md](samples/markor-markdown-reference.md) template (available from new file dialog) showcases some examples.

## Format: todo.txt
#### What is todo.txt?

#### How to mark a task done?
Done tasks are marked by a `x ` in begining of the line and can optionally be moved to a done/archive file.

#### What is a context (@)?
  With contexts you can mark a situation or place. You may use it to categorize your todos. Context is part of todo.txt format, add `@` in front of a word to create one.  
  Examples: @home @work

#### What is a project (+)?
  With projects you can group tasks by a specific project. You may use it to tag your todos with recognizable meta information. Context is part of todo.txt format, add `+` in front of a word to create one.
