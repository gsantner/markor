<p style="font-size: 52px; font-weight: bold; color: #B6383E; text-decoration: underline overline;text-underline-offset: 18px;">Highlights</p>

## Topic A
Multi-selection was added to Markor's dialogs, particularly for the todo.txt format.

* You can now select multiple context & formats to search for, or to insert.

* The search button (top menu) will also show the multi-selection when you have a file in todo.txt format open.
If you select multiple todos and they are not one after the other, then those entries are reorder. 
Afterwards all selected entries will be highlighted in the editor, and you may apply actions on them. Like mark all of them as done or add one or more contexts.

## Search files by content
Since [Markor v2.7](https://gsantner.net/blog/2021/06/26/markor-v2.7-search-in-content-backup-restore.html) you can recursive search for files by their contents.  
This search now also checks contents of files encrypted by Markor.
