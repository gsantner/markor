===== Zim Notebook Structure =====

In the same directory as this page, there is a text file named "notebook.zim". It specifies that this is the root of the notebook.
The text file for each page has a ".txt" file ending. The file name corresponds to the page title, but space characters (" ") are represented as underlines ("_").
All files and pages which are children of this page are located in a folder named according to the page file.

Example: This page is stored as a text file with the name "Root_Page.txt" in the root of the notebook. Subpages and files relative to this page are located in a folder named "Root_Page", which is also in the root of the notebook.

===== Links =====

This is an embedded web link: [[https://github.com/gsantner/markor|Markor on Github]]

To link relatively **down** the hierarchy to a sub page from the current page, use a "+" in front of the path to the page:
[[+Sub Page 1|Sub-page link to Sub Page 1]]
[[+Sub Page 1:Sub Sub Page 1-1|Sub-page link to Sub Sub Page 1-1]]

To link absolutely to any page in the notebook, use ":", followed by the notebook root page:
[[:Root Page:Sub Page 1|Absolute link to Sub Page 1]]

For relative links that go **up** in the hierarchy, see the information [[+Sub Page 1:Sub Sub Page 1-1|on this page]].

If you don't need a different text displayed for the underlying link and just want the link to be visible, there is no need for the "|" delimiter. Just use double square brackets around the link:
[[+Sub Page 1]]

Directly inserted URLs will be displayed as links automatically and don't need any brackets:
https://github.com/gsantner/markor
