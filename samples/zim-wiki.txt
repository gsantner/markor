This ist ''preformatted text'' inline.

'''
This is a preformatted text block.
It spans multiple lines.
And it's visually indented.
'''

We also have _{subscript} and ^{superscript}.

It seems there is no way to combine those styles.
//**this is simply italic**// and you can see the asterisks.
**//This is simply bold//** and you can see the slashes.
__**This is simply marked yellow**__ and you can see the asterisks.
